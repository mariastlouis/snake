# Snake Game revamp

This fun take on the snake game was a paired class project and an exercise in object-oritened programming. The snake, or caterpillar in this case, is made up of an array of objects that pop on or off as the snake moves and grows. 

## Technologies used: 
* JavaScript
* HTML5 Canvas
* Mocha/Chai for testing

3. See the project
* Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.
